# Sync Benchmark

`sync_tick_hub_benchmark` measures the core sync path for a hub-style workload:
one central node stores tick-data chunks from many origins and one replica pulls
those changes. The benchmark uses `DirectSyncPeer` in one process, so the
reported timings cover local changelog reads, pagination, decoding, and local
`handle_push()` work. They do not measure network latency or serialization in a
real transport.

## Build

```bash
cmake -S . -B tmp/build-bench \
    -DMDBXC_DEPS_MODE=BUNDLED \
    -DMDBXC_BUILD_TESTS=OFF \
    -DMDBXC_BUILD_EXAMPLES=OFF \
    -DMDBXC_BUILD_BENCHMARKS=ON \
    -DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=17

cmake --build tmp/build-bench --target sync_tick_hub_benchmark
```

The commands below use Linux/MSYS2 paths. On Windows the executable has the
`.exe` suffix, for example:

```powershell
.\tmp\build-bench\bin\benchmarks\sync_tick_hub_benchmark.exe --preset quick
```

## Built-In Scenarios

Without arguments the benchmark runs the `quick` preset.

```bash
tmp/build-bench/bin/benchmarks/sync_tick_hub_benchmark --preset quick
tmp/build-bench/bin/benchmarks/sync_tick_hub_benchmark --preset realistic
```

| Preset | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `quick` | Short matrix for checking the build and comparing broad changes. |
| `realistic` | Larger manual matrix with more origins and history. The name means "closer to a hub workload", not a universal production model. |

List available presets:

```bash
tmp/build-bench/bin/benchmarks/sync_tick_hub_benchmark --list-presets
```

## Custom Scenario

```bash
tmp/build-bench/bin/benchmarks/sync_tick_hub_benchmark \
    origins historical_chunks_per_origin new_chunks_per_origin \
    ticks_per_chunk max_batches max_bytes
```

Positional arguments are optional from left to right. Omitted trailing values
use the defaults shown below.

| Argument | Default | Meaning |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `origins` | 16 | Number of independent origin nodes represented in the changelog. |
| `historical_chunks_per_origin` | 512 | Number of already existing batches per origin before the first pull. |
| `new_chunks_per_origin` | 8 | Number of new batches per origin in each incremental phase. This value is used twice: once for `incremental_hot` and once after restart. |
| `ticks_per_chunk` | 128 | Number of tick records encoded inside one batch. |
| `max_batches` | 64 | Maximum number of batches returned in one `PullResponse` page. |
| `max_bytes` | 4194304 | Approximate byte budget for one response page. |

## CSV Output

Each scenario prints three phases:

- `full_cold_replica` - initial sync of an empty replica from the accumulated
  historical changelog.
- `incremental_hot` - append new batches and sync again without closing
  connections or reconstructing `SyncEngine`.
- `incremental_after_restart` - close and reopen both databases, reconstruct
  `SyncEngine`, append another range of new batches, and perform incremental
  sync from the persisted receiver cursor.

| Column | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `scenario` | Scenario name. |
| `phase` | One of the three phases listed above. |
| `origins` | Number of origin nodes in the scenario. |
| `historical_chunks_per_origin` | Historical batches seeded per origin before the cold sync. |
| `new_chunks_per_origin` | New batches per origin for each incremental phase. |
| `chunks_per_origin` | Batches per origin present for the measured phase. |
| `ticks_per_chunk` | Tick records encoded in each batch. |
| `max_batches` | Page limit by batch count. |
| `max_bytes` | Page limit by approximate encoded bytes. |
| `seeded_batches` | Batches written locally before the measured pull. |
| `pulled_batches` | Batches received through `PullResponse` pages. |
| `applied_batches` | Batches applied through `SyncEngine::handle_push()`. |
| `pull_pages` | Number of pull requests needed to finish the phase. |
| `origin_index_entries` | Number of origins registered in `_mdbxc_origins` on the primary. |
| `seed_ms` | Time spent writing local data for the phase. |
| `restart_ms` | Time spent closing, reopening, and reconstructing objects for the restart phase. Zero in other phases. |
| `pull_ms` | Time spent in `DirectSyncPeer::pull()` calls. |
| `apply_ms` | Time spent in `SyncEngine::handle_push()` calls. |
| `total_ms` | `seed_ms + restart_ms + pull_ms + apply_ms`. |
| `sync_ms` | `pull_ms + apply_ms`. This excludes seeding and restart time. |
| `pull_pct` | Share of `sync_ms` spent in pull calls. |
| `apply_pct` | Share of `sync_ms` spent applying pages locally. |
| `batches_per_page` | Average `pulled_batches / pull_pages`. |
| `batches_per_sec` | `applied_batches / (pull_ms + apply_ms)`. Seeding and restart time are excluded. |
| `primary_bytes` | MDBX file usage reported for the primary after the phase. |
| `replica_bytes` | MDBX file usage reported for the replica after the phase. |

`origin_index_entries` normally matches `origins` after historical seeding. The
index allows `SyncEngine::handle_pull()` to skip origins where the requester is
already at the latest known sequence number. For lagging origins, the engine
still seeks directly to `have_seq + 1`.

Use `pull_pct` and `apply_pct` before choosing an optimization target. A low
`pull_pct` means the current run is dominated by local apply work; changing the
pull algorithm is unlikely to move total throughput for that workload.

## Comparing Results

1. Build both versions in the same mode, preferably `Release`.
2. Run the same preset or the same custom arguments at least five times.
3. Treat the first run as a filesystem-cache warmup when results vary.
4. Compare median `pull_ms`, `apply_ms`, `pull_pct`, `apply_pct`,
   `pull_pages`, and `batches_per_sec`.
5. Do not compare runs with different compilers, MDBX settings, presets, or
   scenario arguments.
6. Use this benchmark for sync-core changes only. It does not estimate HTTP,
   WebSocket, IPC, or encryption costs.
