/*! \page config_page Database Configuration
\tableofcontents

This page describes each option of the \ref mdbxc::Config class and how it
affects the resulting MDBX environment. These settings are passed to
\ref mdbxc::Connection when opening the database and translate directly to
MDBX API calls or flags.

- **pathname**: Location of the database files. If `relative_to_exe` is true
  and the path is relative, it is resolved against the directory of the running
  executable.
- **size_lower**, **size_now**, **size_upper**, **growth_step**,
  **shrink_threshold**, **page_size**: Parameters of
  \ref mdbx_env_set_geometry that control the file size limits, growth step and
  page size. Use them to preallocate space or restrict database growth. See the
  MDBX manual for details:
  https://libmdbx.dqdkfa.ru/group__c__settings.html#ga79065e4f3c5fb2ad37a52b59224d583e
- **max_readers**: Maximum number of concurrent readers set via
  \ref mdbx_env_set_maxreaders. Increase this if many threads or processes need
  parallel read transactions.
- **max_dbs**: Upper bound for the number of named sub-databases configured via
  \ref mdbx_env_set_maxdbs. Set this to the total tables you expect.
- **read_only**: When true adds `MDBX_RDONLY` so the environment is opened in
  read-only mode.
- **readahead**: If false adds `MDBX_NORDAHEAD`, disabling OS readahead and
  potentially improving random I/O performance.
- **no_subdir**: Adds `MDBX_NOSUBDIR` so the data and lock files are stored next
  to each other rather than inside a directory.
- **sync_durable**: Adds `MDBX_SYNC_DURABLE` forcing an fsync after each commit
  for maximum durability at the cost of latency.
- **writemap_mode**: Adds `MDBX_WRITEMAP` to map pages writable. This can speed
  up modifications but may increase virtual memory usage and requires reliable
  syncing.
- **relative_to_exe**: When set, resolves relative paths as described for
  `pathname`.

Tune these options to balance performance and durability. Combining
`writemap_mode` with `sync_durable` mimics MDBX's default safe mode, while
disabling `sync_durable` trades safety for throughput. For more guidance see
the official MDBX documentation: https://libmdbx.dqdkfa.ru/.
