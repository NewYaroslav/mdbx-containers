# Sync Subsystem Design (target: v0.1)

## Scope

Multi-master replication of logical MDBX tables between node-local envs.
Wire is transport-agnostic, codec is versioned, storage uses named DBIs.

## Already implemented (merged into main)

- Public types in `include/mdbx_containers/sync/`:
  `Common`, `ChangeAccumulator`, `ChangeBatch`, `ChangeOp`, `Cancellation`,
  `CodecBounds`, `CodecFlags`, `ConflictPolicy`, `DirectSyncPeer`,
  `IdentityProvider`, `ISyncCaptureSink`, `ISyncPeer`, `Protocol`,
  `SyncCaptureScope`, `SyncCursor`, `SyncEngine`, `SyncWorker`.
- Five system stores under `include/mdbx_containers/sync/stores/`:
  `MetaStore`, `ChangeLogStore`, `OriginIndexStore`, `AppliedStore`,
  `IdentityIndexStore`.
- `ChangeBatchCodec` strict versioned wire format (magic, codec version,
  batch version, batch flags, then payload); rejects unknown mandatory
  flags and version mismatches at both encode and decode.
- `TransportMessageCodec` strict versioned envelope for transport DTOs:
  `PullRequest`, `PullResponse`, `PushRequest`, and `PushResponse`.
  It length-prefixes nested `ChangeBatchCodec` payloads and does not
  serialize operation-local `CancellationToken` state.
- Framework-neutral HTTP-shaped adapter seam: `HttpSyncPeer`,
  `IHttpSyncClient`, `HttpSyncServer`, and `HttpSyncRoutes`. It defines
  route/content-type/body/status mapping over `TransportMessageCodec` but does
  not open sockets or depend on an HTTP framework.
- Framework-neutral WebSocket-shaped adapter seam: `WebSocketSyncPeer`,
  `IWebSocketSyncChannel`, and `WebSocketSyncServer`. It defines a complete
  binary-message request/response contract over `TransportMessageCodec` but
  does not open sockets, own sessions, or depend on a WebSocket framework.
- `sync/transport.hpp` umbrella for framework-neutral transport seams and
  middleware.
- Optional ready-made Simple-Web HTTP/WebSocket bindings under
  `sync/transports/simple_web/` plus socket-backed examples over Simple-Web-Server /
  Simple-WebSocket-Server, standalone Asio, and a process-supervised HTTP
  node-fleet example over tiny-process-library. These integrations are behind
  explicit CMake options, not mandatory runtime dependencies. The backend
  umbrella is `sync/transports/simple_web.hpp`; HTTP-only or WebSocket-only
  targets can include the narrower backend-specific header. Targets that link
  these dependency backends receive `MDBXC_HAS_SIMPLE_WEB_HTTP_TRANSPORT` and/or
  `MDBXC_HAS_SIMPLE_WEB_WEBSOCKET_TRANSPORT`.
- Optional ready-made Kurlyk/libcurl HTTP client binding under
  `sync/transports/kurlyk/`. It implements only the client-side
  `IHttpSyncClient` seam and can be paired with any server binding that exposes
  the framework-neutral `HttpSyncServer` contract. Targets that link the
  backend receive `MDBXC_HAS_KURLYK_HTTP_TRANSPORT`.
- Transport middleware helpers: `SyncPeerMiddleware`,
  `HttpSyncClientMiddleware`, allow-list policies, fixed-budget rate limiting,
  HTTP request-context bearer/remote-address/fixed-window policies,
  WebSocket session identity policy, bearer token to `NodeId` binding,
  HTTP retry status classification,
  `Retry-After`/`WWW-Authenticate` rejection headers, and a metrics observer.
  These wrap transport adapters and do not change the sync DTO wire format.
- Change capture hooks: `Connection::attach_sync_capture()`,
  `BaseTable::record_op()`, and the transaction pre-commit hook route table
  writes into `ThreadLocalChangeAccumulator`, which appends one local
  `ChangeBatch` per committing write transaction.
- `SyncEngine` pull / push / apply protocol logic, `DirectSyncPeer`
  in-process transport, detailed apply conflict diagnostics, multi-origin
  pagination, origin-index fallback for legacy changelogs, and
  `make_push_request()` for example / transport code.
- Replicated table operation capture for `KeyValueTable`, `KeyTable`,
  `ValueTable`, and `SequenceTable` normal write paths, including bulk
  upserts, reconcile deletes, singleton value writes, and range erases.
  `SequenceTable` `append()` remains a local single-writer operation with
  existing external synchronisation requirements. `VectorStore` is covered
  indirectly because its persistent write path uses `SequenceTable` and
  `KeyValueTable`.
- End-to-end replication tests cover `ValueTable`, `KeyValueTable`,
  `KeyTable`, `SequenceTable` insert/update/delete including empty serialized
  values, and `VectorStore` add/erase/rebuild through its public API.
- `ConflictPolicy::Reject` is the default. `ConflictPolicy::LastWriterWins`
  is declared for future logical-key conflict resolution; `SyncEngine`
  rejects it until a reliable conflict authority exists.
- `SyncWorker` background pull/apply lifecycle, cooperative cancellation
  tokens, best-effort peer cancellation hook, and focused worker tests.
- Manual hub-style benchmark (`sync_tick_hub_benchmark`) plus opt-in and
  scheduled stress coverage for multi-origin sync paths.

## v0.1 table support matrix

| Type | Sync v0.1 status | Notes |
|------|------------------|-------|
| `KeyValueTable` | Supported | Captures normal put/delete paths, bulk append, reconcile puts/deletes, range erase, and clear-table ops. |
| `KeyTable` | Supported | Captures insert/delete, range erase, reconcile/clear paths that operate on physical keys. |
| `ValueTable` | Supported | Captures singleton put/delete/clear using its fixed physical key. |
| `SequenceTable` | Supported | Captures set/append/delete/clear against stable `uint64_t` record ids. `append()` remains a local single-writer helper; external synchronization is still required for concurrent appenders. |
| `VectorStore` | Supported indirectly | Does not own a separate wire format. Its persistent writes go through `SequenceTable` and `KeyValueTable` member tables. Already-open instances refresh their RAM index lazily after completed remote apply when the connection sync-apply generation changes. |
| `AnyValueTable` | Not supported in v0.1 | Deferred until heterogeneous value type tags are part of the sync wire format. |
| `KeyMultiValueTable` | Not supported in v0.1 | Deferred until unordered multiset replication and DUPSORT duplicate-value payload framing are implemented and tested. |
| `HashedKeyValueStore` | Not supported in v0.1 | Deferred until hash-index and identity-key mapping semantics are specified. |

Do not add `record_op()` paths for unsupported table types without first
updating this design document and adding round-trip replication tests for the
new wire-format semantics.

`VectorStore` collection names are validated instead of sanitized. Names must
be non-empty and contain only ASCII letters, digits, `_`, and `-`; unsupported
characters are rejected before internal DBI names are built. This prevents
different logical collections from collapsing to the same physical DBI names.

`Connection::sync_apply_generation()` is a coarse invalidation marker for
remote sync apply. `SyncEngine::handle_push()` increments it after a successful
commit that applied at least one incoming operation. `VectorStore` stores the
last seen generation and rebuilds its in-memory index before index-dependent
operations when the value changes. A connection-level apply/read barrier
serializes remote apply commits with cache-backed `VectorStore` operations.
C++17 builds use `std::shared_mutex` so different cache-backed readers can
share the connection read side. Each `VectorStore` instance still serializes
its own public operations with an instance mutex to preserve the existing table
wrapper thread-safety contract. C++11 builds fall back to an exclusive
connection mutex model.

## Deferred `KeyMultiValueTable` sync design

This section documents the intended direction for future
`KeyMultiValueTable` replication. It is a design contract only:
`KeyMultiValueTable` still emits no `ChangeOp` in sync v0.1.

`KeyMultiValueTable` cannot safely reuse the v0.1 raw DBI put/delete model as
an undocumented implementation detail. The table stores one MDBX DUPSORT record
per logical pair, but the duplicate value is not just the serialized public
value. It is:

```text
stored duplicate value = sequence-prefix || serialized-value
```

The sequence prefix preserves repeated identical `(key, value)` pairs as
separate physical records and also affects iteration order for values under the
same key. Public reads strip the prefix. Public `erase(key, value)` removes all
duplicate records whose stripped payload equals `serialized-value`. Therefore a
future `KeyMultiValueTable` wire format must choose and test an explicit
multiset model instead of assuming that a physical key, a stripped value, or a
locally assigned sequence prefix uniquely identifies one cross-node record.

The first sync design for `KeyMultiValueTable` targets unordered multiset
preservation under single-writer or causally serialized updates:

```text
for every serialized key and serialized public value:
    count(key, value) is preserved after replaying the same ordered operation history
```

General concurrent multi-writer convergence is not guaranteed by the operation
set below. Destructive operations are not commutative with concurrent inserts:
`EraseAllValues`, `EraseKey`, `EraseRange`, and `Clear` can produce different
final counts when different replicas observe local writes and remote deletes in
different orders. Supporting that case requires an explicit conflict model,
such as a single authoritative writer per key/range, a deterministic global
operation order with history replay, CRDT tagged occurrences with tombstones, or
an LWW/version policy for destructive operations. That design is deferred.

Order-sensitive APIs such as `find(key)`, `retrieve_all_vector()`, and
`range_vector()` may expose different value order on different nodes when
multiple nodes write values for the same key. The order and multiplicity
converge only when the application uses one authoritative writer for the
relevant key/logical dataset or otherwise serializes conflicting updates before
they are replicated. Ordered distributed history belongs to a separate future
table.

Planned logical operations:

| Operation | Required payload | Apply semantics |
|-----------|------------------|-----------------|
| `InsertOne` | serialized key, serialized public value | Add one logical pair. The replica assigns its own local duplicate sequence prefix. |
| `EraseKey` | serialized key | Remove all values for the key. |
| `EraseOneValue` | serialized key, serialized public value | Remove one matching repeated value for the key, if one exists. This is needed for `reconcile()` surplus deletes. |
| `EraseAllValues` | serialized key, serialized public value | Remove all exact matching repeated values for the key, matching current public `erase(key, value)` semantics. |
| `EraseRange` | serialized inclusive key range | Remove every physical pair whose key is in the range. |
| `Clear` | no key/value payload | Remove all pairs in the table. |

These operations require an explicit wire extension. Do not encode them as
plain v0.1 `ChangeOpType::Put` / `Delete` records against the DUPSORT DBI:
that would leak the local sequence-prefixed duplicate value and would make
remote replay depend on another node's private prefix allocator. A future
implementation must add either a table-kind/sub-operation field to `ChangeOp`
or a versioned table-specific payload envelope before enabling capture.
Receivers must not attempt raw apply when they do not understand the extension.
An old v0.1 decoder can only fail closed at the codec/framing boundary, which
normally surfaces as a transport/framing rejection rather than a structured
`PushResponse`. A capability-aware receiver may return a structured permanent
sync error such as `UnsupportedCapability` only after it can parse the common
envelope and determine that the table-specific operation is unsupported.

Implementation phases:

1. Add a capability-readable envelope and codec framing for a
   `KeyMultiValueTable` operation subtype. Keep the subtype behind a new
   mandatory batch/op capability bit so old decoders fail closed before apply,
   while upgraded decoders can reject unsupported capability combinations as
   structured permanent sync errors.
2. Implement apply helpers that call the public/logical multivalue semantics:
   assign a fresh local duplicate prefix on `InsertOne`; match stripped public
   values for `EraseOneValue` and `EraseAllValues`; use public key ordering for
   range erasure.
3. Add capture only after every mutating public method maps to one of the
   logical operations above. A method that mutates the table but emits no
   operation keeps the wrapper unsupported.
4. Add negative compatibility tests: old decoders must reject the extension at
   the framing boundary, while capability-aware decoders that lack the
   `KeyMultiValueTable` subtype must return a structured permanent sync error.
5. Add round-trip tests before documenting the wrapper as supported. Tests must
   compare logical multiset counts, not raw duplicate bytes or local iteration
   order.

`append()` can be represented as a sequence of `InsertOne` operations in the
same local batch. `erase(key, value)` should emit `EraseAllValues`.
`reconcile()` should emit one `EraseOneValue` per surplus occurrence and one
`InsertOne` per missing occurrence so that repeated identical pairs preserve
their final multiplicity. If a future implementation captures lower-level
physical deletes during `reconcile()` or range erase, it must copy cursor keys
and duplicate values before `mdbx_cursor_del()` and must still publish logical
operations whose replay is deterministic on another node.

The wire payload should carry the stripped public value, not the local
sequence-prefixed duplicate bytes. This keeps replicas free to assign local
duplicate sequence prefixes while preserving observable multiset state for the
supported single-writer or causally serialized case:

```text
count(key), count(key, value), and per-pair multiplicity
```

Neither order-sensitive iteration nor concurrent destructive-update convergence
is guaranteed for general multi-writer `KeyMultiValueTable` replication. The
sequence prefix remains a local storage detail and is not a cross-node identity.

### Future ordered table

If the library needs replicated per-key histories, event timelines, queues, or
other APIs where cross-node order is part of the contract, add a separate
`KeyOrderedMultiValueTable<K, V>` instead of overloading
`KeyMultiValueTable`. That table should store an explicit globally stable order
identity, for example:

```text
ordered duplicate value = global-order-key || serialized-value
global-order-key        = origin-node-id || origin-local-sequence || op-index
```

The exact fields are deferred, but the important property is that the order key
is carried on the wire and replayed unchanged by replicas. With the illustrative
fields above, this is only a deterministic presentation order: lexicographic
comparison groups operations by `origin-node-id` before the origin-local
sequence. It is not wall-clock insertion time and does not express causal order
between nodes. A causally meaningful distributed history would need an explicit
Lamport/HLC-style component or another causal-ordering model. The ordered table
will need its own storage format, delete semantics, conflict semantics, and
round-trip tests; it is not part of `KeyMultiValueTable` v0.1/v0.2 multiset
sync.

Required tests before enabling capture:

- codec tests proving unknown multivalue operation bits/subtypes are rejected by
  older or capability-limited decoders;
- sink-level tests for `insert()`, `append()`, `erase(key)`,
  `erase(key, value)`, `erase_range()`, `clear()`, and `reconcile()`;
- round-trip tests that preserve repeated identical `(key, value)`
  multiplicity under a single writer and under causally serialized updates;
- multi-writer same-key tests that prove order-sensitive APIs and destructive
  update conflicts are not claimed to converge unless the scenario uses one
  authoritative writer or another explicit conflict policy;
- pagination and restart tests, including persisted applied cursor behavior;
- idempotent replay checks for already-applied batches;
- negative tests proving unsupported `AnyValueTable` and `HashedKeyValueStore`
  still emit no `ChangeOp` until their own wire formats are defined.

## Planned before v0.1 release (NOT YET implemented)

- Full export/import via `seq=0, BATCH_HAS_MORE` chunks for empty replicas.

## What v0.1 does NOT cover (deferred to v0.2)

For the table-by-table support status, capture coverage, and negative test
anchors, see the
[Sync table coverage matrix](/guides/sync-table-coverage.md).

- `HashedKeyValueStore` — internal hash index layout complicates the wire
  format; deferred until an explicit identity-mapping scheme lands.
- `KeyMultiValueTable` — DUPSORT duplicate values need the unordered multiset
  model described above before capture can be enabled. Ordered distributed
  histories are deferred to a future `KeyOrderedMultiValueTable<K, V>`.
- `AnyValueTable` — heterogeneous values need type-tag propagation on the wire.
- `IdentityProvider` integration in `BaseTable` — declared in v0.1, no
  write path until HashedKeyValueStore.
- Specialized table types not listed in the implemented scope are not treated
  as sync-covered without explicit wire-format design and round-trip tests.
- Automatic remap of physical `storage_key` from logical `identity_key`.
- HLC or other production authority for logical-key `LastWriterWins`.
  `time_unix_ns` is metadata only, not a reliable conflict authority. The
  current apply path does not maintain enough identity-index conflict state to
  use `LastWriterWins`, so `SyncEngine` rejects that policy.
- `Custom` conflict resolver — schema-level callback; deferred until the
  first real consumer needs it.
- Production-grade deployment wrappers for concrete socket-bound HTTP and
  WebSocket transports (`Boost.Beast`, libcurl, Simple-Web-Server, or another
  framework) with deployment-specific lifecycle, TLS, reconnect, and
  observability policy. The optional Simple-Web bindings are convenience and
  reference integrations; production services may still wrap or replace them
  for their own operations model.
- `zstd` compression — reserved flag, encoder throws, decoder rejects.

## Endianness policy (do not change)

| Layer | Endianness | Reason |
|-------|------------|--------|
| Payload integer fields | little-endian | Native on Windows/Linux/ARM; round-trip is platform-agnostic and cheap. |
| Wire magic, codec version, batch version | ASCII (`MDBXCSYN`) | Independent of byte order. |
| Codec integer fields (`codec_version`, `batch_version`, `batch_flags`, `seq` field, `time_unix_ns`, `ops_count`, op fields) | little-endian | Never sorted on the wire. |
| `ChangeLogStore` key `seq` part | **big-endian** | Range scans (`prune_up_to`, future gap detection) must preserve numeric order under MDBX bytewise compare. LE would sort 256 before 1. |
| `IdentityIndexStore` length prefix `u32 dbi_name_len` | little-endian | Read and written as a single u32, never sorted. |
| All other key bytes (origins, raw `storage_key`, raw `identity_key`, dbi_name bytes) | opaque bytes | Layout defined by the application, not by the codec. |

Sync v0.1 replicates application table keys as raw physical `storage_key`
bytes. For `MDBX_INTEGERKEY` tables this targets ordinary Windows/Linux/macOS
deployments on little-endian x86_64/aarch64-class platforms. It is not a
cross-endian typed key wire format. Use fixed-width key types for schemas that
must be replicated between different C++ ABIs; ABI-dependent source types such
as `long` and `wchar_t` have canonical storage widths, but their value domain
is still the local C++ type domain.

If you add a new ordered numeric key in the future: big-endian. If you add
any new payload integer: little-endian.

## Stores

The `_mdbxc_` DBI prefix is reserved for library-owned stores. Application
tables must not use that prefix, and `SyncEngine` rejects incoming `ChangeOp`
entries whose `dbi_name` targets the reserved namespace before applying any
operation from the containing batch. A multi-batch `PushRequest` is still
atomic: earlier batches in the same request are rolled back when a later batch
is rejected.

### `_mdbxc_meta` (MetaStore)

| Tag | Field | Type | Notes |
|-----|-------|------|-------|
| `0x01` | `db_uuid` | 16 bytes | Stable for the lifetime of this logical database. |
| `0x02` | `node_id` | 16 bytes | Stable for the lifetime of this replication node. |
| `0x03` | `schema_version` | u32 LE | Bumped only when `ChangeBatch` layout or semantics change incompatibly. |
| `0x04` | `local_seq` | u64 LE | Monotonic per-node counter; `increment_local_seq` is the only mutator. |
| `0x05` | `created_at_ms` | u64 LE | Wall-clock metadata, not authority for any conflict. |

### `_mdbxc_changelog` (ChangeLogStore)

| | |
|---|---|
| Key | `origin_node_id (16 raw) ‖ seq (8 BE)` |
| Value | raw `ChangeBatchCodec::encode()` bytes, opaque to this store |
| Insertion | `MDBX_NOOVERWRITE` so accidental `(origin, seq)` reuse throws |
| Retention | explicit `prune_up_to(origin, up_to)` removes records where `seq <= up_to` |

`prune_up_to` opens a cursor, walks from `(origin, 0)` until `mdbx_cmp > (origin, up_to)`,
deletes each hit, then closes. The boundary comparison is on the bytewise
key, which is why `seq` is big-endian in the key.
Pull detects when `request.have + 1` is older than the earliest retained
changelog record for a known origin and returns
`PullResponse{ok=false, error_code=SnapshotRequired}` instead of streaming a
later non-contiguous batch. Until the reserved full snapshot protocol exists,
callers must provision a fresh replica or use an application-defined snapshot
outside sync v0.1.

### `_mdbxc_origins` (OriginIndexStore)

| | |
|---|---|
| Key | `origin_node_id` (16 raw bytes) |
| Value | u64 LE - max known changelog `seq` for that origin |

This index is a discovery accelerator for hub-style pull. `ChangeLogStore::append`
updates it atomically with the changelog row. Pull uses the indexed tail to skip
origins where the requester already has `last_seq`, then still seeks exact
`have_seq + 1` changelog keys for origins with possible new batches. When an
upgraded database has legacy changelog rows but no `_mdbxc_origins`, the first
writable append backfills the index by scanning existing changelog keys.
Read-only pull keeps a compatibility fallback: if `_mdbxc_origins` is absent or
empty, origin discovery scans `_mdbxc_changelog`.

`ChangeLogStore::origin_index_matches_changelog()` compares the index against
the changelog-derived origin tails. `ChangeLogStore::rebuild_origin_index()`
is the explicit maintenance path for a manually damaged or otherwise partial
`_mdbxc_origins` DBI; ordinary pull does not rebuild metadata in a read-only
transaction.

These maintenance operations scan the changelog. Use them for startup
diagnostics, manual repair, or rare integrity checks; do not place them in the
normal background-sync loop or per-pull hot path.

### `_mdbxc_applied` (AppliedStore)

| | |
|---|---|
| Key | `origin_node_id` (16 raw bytes) |
| Value | u64 LE — last contiguous applied `seq` |

`SyncEngine` invariant: writes to this store are always contiguous. If
`incoming.seq > last + 1`, the current v0.1 apply path reports a
`SequenceGap` conflict and stores no pending queue; the caller must retry after
missing batches arrive. If `incoming.seq <= last`, the batch is a redundant
replay and is skipped.

### `_mdbxc_identity_index` (IdentityIndexStore) — declared in v0.1, write path deferred

| | |
|---|---|
| Key | `u32 dbi_name_len le ‖ dbi_name bytes ‖ identity_key bytes` |
| Value | `IdentityIndexValue { storage_key, origin_node_id, seq, revision_key, flags }` |

Length-prefix on `dbi_name` is mandatory: without it, `("ab","c")` and
`("a","bc")` collide on the same record. The value layout is opaque and
must contain enough metadata to resolve an `(dbi, identity_key)` entry
back to a physical `storage_key` without re-reading the user table.

`IDENTITY_TOMBSTONE` flag bit marks deleted logical records while keeping
the row readable for older incoming batches that still reference the key.
Real removal is explicit via `erase()`.

## Codec — `ChangeBatchCodec`

See `ChangeBatchCodec.hpp` layout comment for the full byte layout. Locked
contract:

- Magic: 8 bytes `MDBXCSYN`.
- Mandatory unknown batch flag bits → decoder throws.
- `BATCH_COMPRESSED_ZSTD` is reserved and rejected at both encode and
  decode paths in v0.1.
- Encoder rejects `ChangeBatch::version != 1`, `op_type > ClearTable`,
  unknown op flag bits, `OP_TOMBSTONE` with non-empty value, and the
  `OP_HAS_*_KEY` flags with empty payloads.
- Decoder rejects trailing bytes when called with `bytes_read == nullptr`
  or via `decode_exact`.

## Codec - `TransportMessageCodec`

Transport DTOs use a separate envelope from individual `ChangeBatch` records.
This lets HTTP, WebSocket, IPC, or message-queue adapters exchange one
request/response object without inventing per-adapter framing for the sync
payload itself.

Locked contract:

- Magic: 8 bytes `MDBXCPRT`.
- Version: u16 little-endian, currently `4`.
- Message type: u8 (`1=PullRequest`, `2=PullResponse`, `3=PushRequest`,
  `4=PushResponse`).
- Message flags: u32 little-endian, currently zero. Unknown non-zero flags are
  rejected.
- Payload integers are little-endian.
- `SyncCursor` is encoded as `u32 count` followed by `(NodeId, u64 seq)`
  entries.
- `ChangeBatch` values inside pull/push messages are encoded as
  `u32 byte_length` plus exact `ChangeBatchCodec` bytes.
- `PullResponse` carries both `remote_have` (responder applied cursor) and
  optional `remote_tail` (responder changelog tail) so receivers can report
  catch-up progress without changing pagination semantics.
- `PullRequest::max_bytes` is a soft page budget. A responder may return one
  retained changelog batch whose encoded size exceeds `max_bytes` when that
  batch is the next required batch. `PullRequest::max_single_batch_bytes` is
  the hard per-batch budget; exceeding it returns `BatchTooLarge`.
- `PullResponse` and `PushResponse` carry a structured
  `SyncResponseErrorCode` plus an `error_retryable` boolean after their
  human-readable error string. `None` means no structured sync-level
  classification is available. `error_retryable` describes protocol-level
  recovery, not blind replay of the identical request: for example a
  `SequenceGap` apply conflict is retryable after the caller catches up from a
  fresher cursor, while DBI flag conflicts and unsupported full snapshots are
  permanent until the caller changes behavior. `SnapshotRequired` means the
  requested changelog range was pruned and cannot be recovered through
  incremental pull. `BatchTooLarge` means a retained changelog entry exceeds
  the requester's hard per-batch limit and is permanent until the requester
  raises that limit or obtains the data through another path. Transport-local
  errors remain represented by adapter status, close codes, response headers,
  and `SyncTransportRetryHint`.
- `CancellationToken` fields in request DTOs are local call-control state and
  are never serialized. Decoded request DTOs contain default non-cancellable
  tokens.
- Decoders reject trailing bytes, truncated messages, invalid boolean values,
  wrong message types, unsupported versions, and configured size-limit
  violations.
- `peek_message_type()` validates the shared envelope and returns only the
  message kind. It is for message-oriented adapters such as WebSocket servers
  that dispatch complete binary messages before decoding the type-specific
  payload.
- A null `CodecBounds` argument uses the default `CodecBounds` limits at this
  transport layer; adapters may pass stricter limits for their deployment.

## Sync flow (current v0.1 core behavior)

Default round shape, single-writer friendly and the base case for
multi-master:

```
origin A writes
    -> Transaction::commit pre-commit hook
        -> ChangeAccumulator.flush (writes ChangeLogStore; OriginIndexStore
           is updated by ChangeLogStore::append)
            -> mdbx_txn_commit() — changes land atomically

receiver B
    -> pull / push via ISyncPeer
        -> SyncEngine.handle_push / handle_pull
            -> begin write txn
                if already_applied(origin, seq): skip
                if sequence gap: conflict / rollback
                for op in batch.ops: apply raw dbi_op
                mark_applied(origin, seq)
            -> commit
```

Application integration contract:

- supported table write methods keep the same public API with or without sync;
- callers do not wrap each individual `insert`, `insert_or_assign`, `erase`,
  `reconcile`, or range erase in a sync-specific call;
- `Connection::attach_sync_capture()` installs the capture sink for commits on
  that connection; `SyncCaptureScope` is the RAII helper for temporary
  attachments and restores the previous sink when the scope ends; supported
  write operations are recorded by table code and flushed by the transaction
  pre-commit hook;
- choose the scope helper for bounded write phases owned by one stack frame;
  choose explicit attach/detach only for a wider component lifecycle where the
  caller can prove no concurrent table operation or active transaction races
  with capture attachment changes;
- nested `SyncCaptureScope` objects must be detached or destroyed in strict
  LIFO order. Explicit out-of-order `detach()` is rejected, and raw
  attach/detach calls must not replace the connection sink while a scope owns
  it;
- a standalone write method call that opens its own transaction commits as one
  local change batch;
- an explicit transaction passed through several supported table calls commits
  those writes atomically and flushes one local change batch;
- reads, searches, range scans, and failed/rolled-back transactions emit no
  change batch;
- local commit never contacts a remote node. Pull/push delivery is performed
  later by explicit protocol code or by `SyncWorker` through an `ISyncPeer`.

Cold replica sync currently uses changelog replay:

```
B: empty cursor
    -> pull request, have = empty
A: handle_pull treats it as a full changelog replay across known origins
    -> streams persisted ChangeBatches from seq=1 with pagination limits
B: applies each page as above
    -> onward sync is incremental pull-from-have
```

The reserved `seq=0, BATCH_HAS_MORE` full export/import format remains planned
for v0.1 and is not the current cold-replica implementation.
`PullRequest::request_full_snapshot=true` is rejected explicitly until that
format is implemented. In v0.1 this is a sync-level protocol rejection carried
as `PullResponse{ok=false, error=..., error_code=UnsupportedFullSnapshot}`; it
does not produce a transport retry hint because the server returned a valid
sync response rather than a transport failure.
If changelog pruning removed entries needed by the requester's cursor,
`handle_pull()` returns `SnapshotRequired` with no batches. This is also a
valid sync response, not a transport failure.
`SyncWorkerPermanentFailurePolicy` is transport-only; workers still expose
sync-level response errors through round results, stage events, and status
snapshots without treating them as permanent transport failures.

### Deferred full snapshot protocol

The future full snapshot protocol must be explicit rather than another spelling
of retained changelog replay. The reserved request shape is
`PullRequest::request_full_snapshot=true`; responders that implement it should
return snapshot chunks only when the caller requested that mode, never as an
implicit fallback from a normal incremental pull.

Required protocol properties before enabling the flag:

- A full snapshot export is a named snapshot session. The first response must
  return an opaque `snapshot_id` and all later pages must present the same id;
  pages with an unknown, expired, or mismatched id are rejected instead of being
  merged into the receiver state.
- The session is tied to one stable source view. All snapshot data, the exported
  DBI manifest, the source `NodeId`, the `db_id`, and the advertised changelog
  tail must come from one MDBX read transaction or from a materialized snapshot
  created from that read transaction. The advertised tail is immutable for the
  whole session.
- The first page carries a manifest before any data is considered complete. The
  manifest lists the selected user DBIs, DBI flags, empty source DBIs, the fixed
  source identity, the immutable changelog tail, the replacement scope, and a
  manifest version/hash that later pages repeat. A receiver must reject chunks
  whose manifest identity differs from the first page.
- Receiver-only DBIs are an explicit policy decision, not an accidental side
  effect. The manifest must say whether the snapshot replaces the complete
  database scope or only the listed DBIs; complete replacement may clear/drop
  receiver-only user DBIs only when the caller opted into that scope. Otherwise
  receiver-only DBIs are preserved or the import fails closed before data apply.
- Snapshot chunks must be distinguishable from ordinary changelog batches.
  The reserved shape is `ChangeBatch{seq=0, batch_flags=BATCH_HAS_MORE...}`
  with a snapshot-specific flag or versioned envelope added before release.
  Ordinary local changelog batches keep `seq > 0`.
- A chunk carries physical `ClearTable` / `Put` operations for user DBIs only.
  It must not export or overwrite reserved `_mdbxc_` sync metadata DBIs through
  the normal user-operation path.
- Snapshot apply is a replacement operation for the selected database content:
  the receiver must clear each exported user DBI before applying that DBI's
  first snapshot entries, then apply later chunks idempotently or reject
  ambiguous resume attempts.
- Metadata bootstrap is separate from user data import. After the snapshot data
  is committed, the receiver records applied cursors consistent with the
  responder's advertised changelog tail so the next round can continue through
  ordinary incremental pull.
- Chunk pagination must use the existing pull limits: `max_bytes` as a soft page
  budget and `max_single_batch_bytes` as a hard limit for a single encoded
  snapshot chunk. If one logical DBI chunk cannot fit under the hard limit, the
  snapshot encoder must split it further or return a structured permanent sync
  error.
- Multi-page sessions must carry an explicit continuation token. The token is
  opaque to callers, but it must identify the next physical position precisely
  enough to resume within duplicate-value tables, for example by encoding the
  DBI name, storage key, duplicate position, and manifest identity. Tokens may
  expire; expired or foreign tokens are permanent sync-level rejections and do
  not advance receiver state.
- A failed snapshot apply must not leave the receiver advertising a partially
  advanced applied cursor. Either each chunk is independently resumable with
  explicit snapshot state, or the initial implementation must require a fresh
  replica directory and fail closed on interruption.
- `SnapshotRequired` remains the incremental-pull recovery signal. It tells the
  caller that retained changelog replay cannot satisfy the request; the caller
  may then make a separate `request_full_snapshot=true` request once this
  protocol exists.

Until these details are implemented and covered by round-trip tests,
`request_full_snapshot=true` remains a permanent sync-level rejection.

## Background worker lifecycle

`SyncWorker` is the minimal background driver for `SyncEngine + ISyncPeer`.
It owns its thread but does not own the engine, peer, or connection. The
runtime state shape is:

```
Stopped -> Starting -> Idle -> Pulling -> Applying -> Idle
                              -> Backoff -> Idle
                              -> Stopping -> Stopped
                              -> Failed
```

Worker invariants:

- no local MDBX transaction is held while waiting in `ISyncPeer::pull()`;
- no local MDBX transaction is held during idle or backoff sleeps;
- pulled pages are applied through `SyncEngine::handle_push()`, so each page
  uses one short local write transaction;
- stop requests cancel the active `PullRequest::cancel_token` and call
  `ISyncPeer::request_cancel()` at most once for each observed in-flight
  peer pull call, and a page returned after stop was requested is not applied;
- a stop request recorded before peer-call activation prevents the next pull
  call from starting;
- `stop()`, `join()`, and destruction may wait for an in-flight peer call to
  return when the concrete transport does not support cancellation;
- lifecycle mutations (`start`, `stop`, `join`, `run_once`) are caller-serialized,
  while `request_stop`, `state`, `last_error`, `last_observer_error`, and
  `wait_until_state` are thread-safe;
- optional `ISyncWorkerObserver` callbacks report coarse sync stages
  (`round`, `pull`, `apply`, `backoff`), page application, round completion,
  and backoff entry synchronously on the thread that runs the sync round;
  observer implementations must outlive the worker, return quickly, and avoid
  caller-serialized lifecycle calls from worker-thread callbacks;
- worker stage and round events include a best-effort progress estimate derived
  from the latest `PullResponse::remote_tail` cursor and the receiver cursor;
  it reports known catch-up progress only, not future writes or wall-clock ETA;
- observer exceptions never fail the sync round and are reported through
  `last_observer_error`; they do not overwrite `last_error`, which remains
  reserved for pull/apply, cancellation, and lifecycle failures;
- the `SyncWorker` object must outlive its background thread and must not be
  destroyed from callbacks running on that worker thread;
- `Transaction`, raw `MDBX_txn*`, and cursors stay on the thread that opened
  them and never cross the worker boundary.

The worker is a lifecycle/concurrency helper, not a transport. HTTP/WebSocket
peers remain separate adapters over `ISyncPeer`. Transport adapters that can
interrupt blocking I/O should poll the request `cancel_token` where possible
and implement `request_cancel()` by using their own timeout, socket shutdown,
or equivalent mechanism when polling alone cannot unblock the operation.

Cancellation intentionally stays minimal in the core API: operation-scoped
tokens plus the existing best-effort peer hook. Do not add callback
registration, generation-based token reuse, or allocation-free state reuse
without evidence from a real transport adapter or benchmark. The preferred next
step for HTTP/WebSocket transports is an adapter-local bridge from
`cancel_token` / `request_cancel()` to the transport library's native timeout,
socket shutdown, or cancellation primitive. Revisit the core API only if that
adapter-local approach proves insufficient, or if benchmark data shows
per-operation cancellation-state allocation on the `pull()` path is a measured
hot spot.

## Transport boundary contract

The `ISyncPeer` interface is the single boundary between the sync core and
any external transport (in-process, HTTP, WebSocket, IPC, message queue).
This section locks in the rules a transport adapter must satisfy, the
places where cancellation must be wired through, and the policy decisions
that stay out of the core API. The design is intentionally minimal: locks
in place until a real adapter shows that core cannot support it.

### Boundary rules

- Only `PullRequest`, `PullResponse`, `PushRequest`, and `PushResponse`
  cross the boundary. Binary adapters should use `TransportMessageCodec`
  for those DTOs unless they deliberately define another documented
  content type. `MDBX_txn*`, `MDBX_cursor*`, `Connection`,
  `SyncEngine`, table objects, the `ISyncCaptureSink`, and the system
  stores (MetaStore, ChangeLogStore, AppliedStore, OriginIndexStore,
  IdentityIndexStore) are thread-owned and never enter a transport
  payload.
- `DirectSyncPeer` forwards request DTOs to another `SyncEngine` in the same
  process and is suitable for tests, examples, and in-process demos.
  `HttpSyncPeer` is a framework-neutral HTTP-shaped adapter over an abstract
  `IHttpSyncClient`; it defines the route/body contract but does not own a
  socket. `WebSocketSyncPeer` is a framework-neutral binary-message adapter
  over an abstract `IWebSocketSyncChannel`; it defines the complete-message
  request/response contract but does not own a socket or session. Production
  code that crosses a process boundary must bind these seams to a transport
  implementation that owns its own connection, threading, and lifecycle.
- A transport adapter does not own the caller's `SyncEngine`. The
  receiver-side `SyncEngine` (the one whose state changed because of a
  remote write) must live on the thread that owns the receiver
  `Connection`. Cross-thread writes are not supported.
- A pull page and the matching apply round are owned by `SyncWorker`
  (background) or by the caller of `run_once()` (foreground). The
  transport's `pull()` returns detached `ChangeBatch` values; the worker
  then calls `SyncEngine::handle_push()` which opens its own short
  write transaction.

### Where socket / RPC timeouts live

Timeouts are an adapter-local concern. The core API exposes no
`timeout` field on `PullRequest`/`PushRequest` and no `set_timeout`
on `ISyncPeer` because transports differ about how a deadline is
expressed (HTTP, libcurl, gRPC, Boost.Asio, raw sockets, ...). The
adapter owns its timeout configuration and is responsible for
honoring it. An adapter that cannot bound a blocking call without
the core's help must say so explicitly in its documentation; do not
silently block forever on the worker thread.
The ready-made Simple-WebSocket client binding exposes
`WebSocketSyncChannelConfig::exchange_timeout` as a whole-exchange deadline
covering connect, request send, and response wait. Zero disables the deadline;
negative values are rejected.

The timeout policy that does belong to the core is the worker
backoff loop: repeated pull failures increase the wait between
attempts up to `SyncWorkerOptions::max_backoff`. That is a cooldown
for failed *rounds*, not a per-call deadline.

### Where the cancellation bridge lives

A transport adapter must implement two cancellation channels, both of
which are already in the public API:

1. `PullRequest::cancel_token` and `PushRequest::cancel_token`.
   `SyncWorker` sets a cancellable token before every `pull()` call and
   requests cancellation on it when `request_stop()` runs. The adapter
   receives the token by value and may poll it during any
   interruptible wait. A `CancellationToken` is cheap to copy and
   non-owning; copies share state with their `CancellationSource`.
2. `ISyncPeer::request_cancel()`. `SyncWorker` calls this hook
   at most once for each observed in-flight `pull()`. The default
   implementation is a no-op so token-only peers stay valid. Adapters
   whose underlying call ignores the token (TCP read, blocking RPC,
   legacy client) must override `request_cancel()` to close their
   socket, shutdown their transport, or call the library's native
   cancellation primitive so the in-flight call returns promptly.

The default adapter-local bridge combines both channels: the adapter
sets the same deadline it would use for a normal timeout, polls the
`cancel_token` while waiting on the underlying socket or future, and
also overrides `request_cancel()` to force the socket into a closed or
half-closed state so any blocking call returns. The bridge must be
documented adapter-side; the core does not assume a specific
mechanism.

Cancellation is best-effort. `SyncWorker::stop()`, `join()`, and
destruction may wait for an in-flight peer call to return when the
adapter cannot interrupt that call. This is acknowledged in
`SyncWorker`'s class docstring and is not a contract violation by
the adapter.

### Where reconnect policy lives

Reconnect policy is transport-local. There is no `reconnect_interval`
on `ISyncPeer` and no retry counter on `SyncWorker` because retry
shapes differ across transports (immediate retry after transient
connection reset, exponential backoff across peer failures, jittered
reconnect for peer discovery, ...). An adapter may own its own
`std::thread` that holds the transport connection and surfaces peer
state through a small `ISyncPeer`-like façade; that façade must still
honor the cancellation bridge above.

The one retry shape that lives in core is the worker backoff loop
on repeated pull failures. It is intentionally distinct from
connection-level reconnect and does not attempt to model
connection-state separately from transport-call failures.

### Where auth, rate limits, TLS, and compression live

Auth, rate limits, allow/deny lists, TLS, and compression are adapter-local.
The core has no
`credentials` field on `PullRequest`/`PushRequest` and no TLS
configuration on `ISyncPeer`. A real adapter typically wraps the
transport with the platform's TLS layer (OpenSSL, Schannel, NSURLSession)
or delegates to a server framework that owns the secure channel.
Identity at the sync layer is `NodeId` (16 bytes); the adapter decides
whether TLS terminates before or after the sync payload is parsed.
Authorization and rate limiting should be implemented as wrappers around
request handling: inspect transport metadata and, when needed, the decoded
DTO header fields (`requester`, `sender`, `db_id`) before dispatching to
`SyncEngine`. Do not put bearer tokens, ACL decisions, or rate-limit counters
inside the sync DTO wire format.

`SyncPeerMiddleware`, `HttpSyncClientMiddleware`, and
`HttpSyncServerMiddleware` are the v0.1 framework-free
building blocks for these wrappers. `NodeDbAllowListPolicy` checks decoded
`requester` / `sender` and `db_id` values. `HttpRouteAllowListPolicy` checks
HTTP-shaped targets before a concrete HTTP client sends bytes.
`HttpSyncRequest` carries adapter-local `headers` and `remote_address` fields;
they are not serialized by `TransportMessageCodec`. `HttpBearerTokenPolicy`,
`HttpBearerNodeIdentityPolicy`, `HttpRemoteAddressAllowListPolicy`, and
`FixedWindowHttpRateLimitPolicy` run on that context before dispatch.
`HttpBearerNodeIdentityPolicy` is the v0.1 authenticated-identity contract:
the bearer token maps to one `NodeId`; a pull request is allowed only when
`PullRequest::requester` matches that authenticated node, and a push request is
allowed only when `PushRequest::sender` matches that authenticated node.
Optional per-token DB access rules validate `db_id` before dispatch.
`SyncDbAccess` makes the intent explicit: a token binding may allow any DB,
deny every DB, or allow only listed DB ids. `HttpBearerNodeIdentityPolicy`
keeps token bindings in `allow any DB` mode until
`allow_db_id_for_token()` switches that token to a restricted list. This keeps
the sync DTOs self-describing while preventing a transport principal from
claiming another node id inside the binary payload.
Rejections may carry response headers such as `WWW-Authenticate` or
`Retry-After`; concrete HTTP bindings must write those headers to the real
response. `HttpSyncHeaders::request_id()` and
`HttpSyncHeaders::trace_id()` define optional adapter-local correlation
headers. They are copied from request to response by the framework-neutral HTTP
server/middleware, but they are not serialized inside sync DTOs.
`FixedBudgetSyncTransportPolicy` is a deterministic fixed-budget limiter useful
for tests, examples, and simple adapters; production adapters can replace it
with a time-window or token-bucket policy while keeping the same middleware
shape. `FixedWindowHttpRateLimitPolicy` accepts an optional non-zero bucket cap;
expired identity buckets are evicted before a new identity is rejected with
`429` and `Retry-After`. `SyncTransportMetricsObserver` records basic call,
rejection, failure, cancel, and batch counters without changing transport
behavior.
`TransportMessageSizePolicy` is a pre-decode guard for HTTP bodies and
WebSocket binary messages. It complements `CodecBounds`: adapters can reject
oversized transport frames before decoding, while the codec still validates the
structured payload.
Ready-made concrete bindings also expose `CodecBounds` in their config objects.
Simple-Web HTTP rejects oversized `Content-Length` before copying the request
body into an adapter DTO and checks the actual buffered body as a fallback.
Simple-WebSocket and Kurlyk/libcurl check their buffered messages before
calling the framework-neutral sync decoder.

These helpers do not replace server-framework authentication or
per-remote-client rate limiting before `HttpSyncServer::handle()`. They also
count middleware hook invocations: if one observer is installed at both the
peer layer and HTTP client layer, a forwarded `request_cancel()` can be counted
once per layer.
For WebSocket, decoded DTO policy can wrap `WebSocketSyncPeer` through
`SyncPeerMiddleware`. Server-side bindings can pass a
`WebSocketSyncRequestContext` to `WebSocketSyncServerMiddleware` after the
concrete WebSocket framework authenticates the session. The framework-specific
token, cookie, mTLS principal, or remote address stays outside the sync DTO;
`WebSocketAuthenticatedNodeIdentityPolicy` receives only the resulting
authenticated `NodeId`, an explicit `SyncDbAccess` rule, and one complete
binary message. WebSocket request contexts default to `deny every DB`, so a
binding must opt into `SyncDbAccess::any()` or allow concrete DB ids for that
session. The policy then requires `PullRequest::requester` or
`PushRequest::sender` to match that authenticated node before dispatching to
`WebSocketSyncServer`. `WebSocketSyncServerMiddleware` preserves policy close
codes by throwing `WebSocketSyncRejected`; concrete bindings should catch it
and send `close_code()` as the WebSocket close frame status.
Backpressure, reconnects, ping/pong, and pre-DTO rate limits remain
binding-local.

Transport retry classification is adapter-level. HTTP 2xx means transport
success; the decoded sync response still needs its own `ok/error` handling.
HTTP `408`, `425`, `429`, `500`, `502`, `503`, and `504` are retryable
transport statuses by default. Auth, authorization, routing, content-type,
payload-size, and malformed-body errors (`400`, `401`, `403`, `404`, `405`,
`413`, `415`) are permanent for the current request unless a higher-level
adapter refreshes credentials or changes the request. `Retry-After` is advisory
transport metadata; `http_sync_retry_hint()` exposes relative
`Retry-After: <delta-seconds>` values without parsing HTTP-date clock policy.
`SyncWorker` backoff remains the core retry loop for failed
sync rounds. For WebSocket, close code `1000` is success; `1001`, local
observations `1005`/`1006`, and server/transient codes `1011`, `1012`, `1013`,
and `1014` are retryable by default. Policy, malformed payload, and oversized
message codes such as `1007`, `1008`, and `1009` are permanent for the current
request. `websocket_sync_retry_hint()` exposes the same retryable flag for
concrete bindings that report close codes.

Peers that can classify adapter failures expose the last observed advice
through `ISyncPeer::last_retry_hint()`. The default implementation returns an
unavailable hint, so existing peers are source-compatible and callers can keep
using their fallback retry policy. Concrete peers should set
`SyncTransportRetryHint::available` when a transport failure was actually
classified, clear stale retry advice after successful operations, and update it
after transport-level failures. With `available=true`, `retryable=false` means
the transport classified the failure as permanent for the current request.
Successful transport responses are not failures and should clear back to an
unavailable hint. The hint is advisory: callers may still use their own retry
scheduler, but `SyncWorker` and examples consume the same transport-neutral
shape without depending on HTTP or WebSocket headers. Worker round and stage
events carry the latest hint for failed pulls. `SyncWorker::status()` exposes a
thread-safe snapshot for polling UIs, health endpoints, and structured logging
code that does not want to reconstruct state from observer callbacks. In
background mode, an available retryable hint with relative `Retry-After`
overrides the current exponential delay for that backoff wait, capped by
`SyncWorkerOptions::max_backoff`. Permanent hints remain advisory by default:
`SyncWorkerPermanentFailurePolicy::KeepRetrying` keeps using the normal
backoff loop. Applications that want a classified permanent transport failure
to stop the background loop can set
`SyncWorkerPermanentFailurePolicy::StopWorker`, which leaves the worker in
`SyncWorkerState::Failed` instead of entering backoff.

`ChangeBatchCodec` already rejects `BATCH_COMPRESSED_ZSTD` at both
encode and decode paths. Adding a real `zstd` backend is a codec
change and belongs in a separate design pass; it is not part of the
transport boundary.

### What the core API explicitly does not do

- It does not own a transport connection.
- It does not expose a per-call timeout on the public DTOs.
- It does not expose authentication, credentials, or tokens.
- It does not own a worker thread for the transport itself; only the
  `SyncWorker` pull/apply loop is provided, and it owns no transport
  state.
- It does not promise graceful shutdown of an in-flight peer call;
  `request_cancel()` is best-effort.

### Adapter-local extension pattern

A concrete socket-bound transport adapter ships as a separate pair of headers
(one client, one server) and is gated by its own build option
(`MDBXC_HTTP_SYNC`, `MDBXC_WEBSOCKET_SYNC`, ...). The adapter:

- implements or reuses `ISyncPeer` on the client side;
- wraps `SyncEngine::handle_pull()` / `handle_push()` on the server
  side, directly, through `HttpSyncServer`, or through `WebSocketSyncServer`;
- owns its own threading model (one acceptor thread, thread pool,
  per-connection thread, ...);
- owns its own timeout configuration;
- documents how its `request_cancel()` translates into the
  underlying transport's interrupt primitive.

The framework-neutral `HttpSyncPeer` / `HttpSyncServer` and
`WebSocketSyncPeer` / `WebSocketSyncServer` seams are part of v0.1. Concrete
server/client bindings remain separate optional integrations; the ready-made
Simple-Web bindings live under `sync/transports/simple_web/` and are not
included by the main sync umbrella header.

The Kurlyk HTTP client binding lives under `sync/transports/kurlyk/` and is
also excluded from the main sync umbrella header. It exists to validate that
HTTP client backends can be swapped at the `IHttpSyncClient` boundary without
changing `SyncEngine`, `HttpSyncPeer`, transport DTOs, or auth/rate-limit
middleware. On Windows/MinGW, its optional example can fetch a pinned
ready-made libcurl package; that fallback is a build-time convenience for the
example target, not a dependency of the sync core.

The `MDBXC_SIMPLE_WEB_HTTP_TRANSPORT`,
`MDBXC_SIMPLE_WEB_WEBSOCKET_TRANSPORT`, and `MDBXC_KURLYK_HTTP_TRANSPORT`
CMake options enable the optional backend dependency targets and their backend
smoke tests. The `MDBXC_HTTP_SYNC_EXAMPLE`,
`MDBXC_WEBSOCKET_SYNC_EXAMPLE`, and `MDBXC_KURLYK_HTTP_SYNC_EXAMPLE` options
only add repository examples on top of those backends; with
`MDBXC_BUILD_EXAMPLES=ON`, they still enable the matching backend for
compatibility with older example build commands. Application code should use
`MDBXC_HAS_SIMPLE_WEB_HTTP_TRANSPORT`,
`MDBXC_HAS_SIMPLE_WEB_WEBSOCKET_TRANSPORT`, and
`MDBXC_HAS_KURLYK_HTTP_TRANSPORT` when it needs conditional includes for
concrete backend headers. Consumers that wire the same third-party dependencies
manually may define the corresponding `MDBXC_HAS_*` macro themselves.

Installed packages export provider functions instead of exporting raw
FetchContent build-tree targets:

```cmake
mdbx_containers_simple_web_http_transport_provide(OUT_TARGET http_target)
mdbx_containers_simple_web_websocket_transport_provide(OUT_TARGET ws_target)
mdbx_containers_kurlyk_http_transport_provide(OUT_TARGET kurlyk_target)
```

The returned targets are
`mdbx_containers::simple_web_http_transport`,
`mdbx_containers::simple_web_websocket_transport`, and
`mdbx_containers::kurlyk_http_transport`. They link the core package target,
enable `MDBXC_SYNC_ENABLED`, fetch or find the optional third-party backend,
and propagate the matching `MDBXC_HAS_*_TRANSPORT` macro. This keeps installed
packages relocatable while preserving the same target-based usage model as the
source-tree examples and tests.

Production deployment details for TLS/WSS, token rotation, graceful shutdown,
structured logging, and offline dependency management are kept in
`guides/sync-transport-production.md`.

Request and trace ids are adapter-local metadata. HTTP bindings carry them in
`X-MDBXC-Sync-Request-Id` and `X-MDBXC-Sync-Trace-Id`; WebSocket bindings may
copy equivalent handshake or session metadata into
`WebSocketSyncRequestContext`. `SyncTransportTraceContext` and the
`*_sync_trace_context()` helpers expose those fields to observers without
adding them to `TransportMessageCodec` DTOs.

## Why `prune_up_to` uses cursor walk + `MDBX_NEXT`

MDBX has no batch "delete by key range" primitive. The supported pattern
for walking and deleting a range is:

```
cursor open
cursor get(MDBX_SET_RANGE, lo) -> k
while cmp(k, hi) <= 0:
    cursor_del(MDBX_CURRENT)
    cursor get(MDBX_NEXT) -> k
cursor close
```

After `cursor_del`, the cursor stays logically on the deleted position; the
next `MDBX_NEXT` advances to the next live record. The loop terminates
when the current key compares greater than `hi` (or when the cursor runs
out of records). This is the only documented way; alternatives either
don't exist or fail on the first record.

## Why `IdentityIndexValue` does not get an extra outer value prefix

Only the **key** is subject to MDBX bytewise uniqueness — different logical
keys can collapse to the same key bytes if the composite key is not encoded
unambiguously. That is why the identity-index key uses:

    u32 dbi_name_len le ‖ dbi_name bytes ‖ identity_key bytes

The **value** for a given key is single-valued and never participates in MDBX
key comparison. It is still a structured payload, so variable-size fields
inside the value (`storage_key`, `revision_key`) are length-prefixed where
needed for decoding.

Do not add an extra outer MDBX-value prefix around `IdentityIndexValue`;
the MDBX value length is already known from `MDBX_val::iov_len`.

When HLC or similar lands in v0.2, it goes in as opaque bytes inside
`revision_key`.

## Deferred to v0.2 with no open issue yet

- `meta_schema_version()` currently returns 1; bump rule + migration
  procedure not defined.
- Public sync API stability after the first external transport adapter.
- `PeerRegistry` for multi-peer fan-out — single peer per sync invocation
  in v0.1.
